tth # PyCitySchools Performance analysis using Pandas
## Over View of the Project: 
* Maria the chief data scientist for city school district system was notified by the school board and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grads for Thomas High School ninth grades appear to have been altered.
* Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonest, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. 
* She had asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs While keeping the rest of the data intact.
* After replacing the math and reading scores, maria would like me to repeat the school district analysis that we did in the module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results:
* District Summary Data:

## Summary and Comparisions:
 ### Changes occures when we change the Thomas High School grade "9th" math and reading scores to NaNs. Out of many four changes can be summarized as below:
 * Change in district summary:
